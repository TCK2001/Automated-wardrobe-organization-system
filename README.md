# Automated-wardrobe-organization-system
## library
+ tkinter
## Motivation
Sometimes, when I have too many clothes, I often forget where my desired clothes are located. Moreover, it's challenging to organize them when there are too many clothes. So, I thought about how great it would be if clothes could be automatically organized and retrieved. Therefore, I implemented it using Python.
## featues
+ Rearranging clothes
+ Adding clothes
+ Removing clothes
+ Organizing clothes
## Description
Imagine that there is a camera in the wardrobe, and it captures the clothes inside the wardrobe.

And we can implement the following functions:
+ Part 1 is to rearrange the location of clothes. In the first blank, enter the location of the clothes to be changed, and in the second blank, enter the location where the clothes will be moved to. When you press the button, the clothes will be moved to the new location.
+ Part 2 is to retrieve clothes. In the blank, enter the location of the clothes to be retrieved, and press the "get a cloth" button. If the wardrobe is messy, you can also press the "sort" button to rearrange the clothes in order.
+ Part 3 is to add new clothes. Similarly, enter the location and color of the clothes to be added in the blanks, and press the button to add them. However, please note that if the wardrobe exceeds its maximum size, a message "It's Full" will be displayed.

### The tkinter interface shown here will eventually become a mobile app, and if the above functions are applied to real wardrobes, it is expected to significantly reduce a lot of time and make life much more efficient.
