# Automated-wardrobe-organization-system
## library
+ tkinter
## Motivation
Sometimes, when I have too many clothes, I often forget where my desired clothes are located. Moreover, it's challenging to organize them when there are too many clothes. So, I thought about how great it would be if clothes could be automatically organized and retrieved. Therefore, I implemented it using Python.
## featues
+ Rearranging clothes
+ Adding clothes
+ Removing clothes
+ Organizing clothes
## Description
Imagine that there is a camera in the wardrobe, and it captures the clothes inside the wardrobe.
